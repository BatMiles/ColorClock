# ColorClock
This project is a JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS clone of the <a href="http://thecolourclock.co.uk/">color clock</a> by <a href="http://www.lookatjack.com/">Jack Huges</a>. The time is mapped to a hexadecimal color code by translating the hours, minutes, and seconds to hex codes for the red, green, and blue channels respectively. Works in web and mobile browsers.
